# High-Level Design Artifact

To outline a high-level system architecture for an eCommerce platform for a medical store specializing in surgical items, we can break down the components into several key areas. The architecture will need to ensure that the platform is scalable, secure, and user-friendly, while also complying with healthcare regulations. Hereâ€™s a structured overview:

### 1. **User Interface (Frontend)**
   - **Web Application**: 
      - Responsive design for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
      - Product catalog layout with filtering options (by category, price, etc.).
      - User registration and login system.
      - Shopping cart functionality.
      - Checkout process with payment gateway integration.
      - Order tracking system for users.

      - Frameworks: Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, etc.
   - **Database Management**:
      - Relational Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for product data, user data, and order history.
      - NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for flexible data storage, especially if product details vary.
   - **API Gateway**:
      - Manages API traffic and routes requests between the frontend and backend services.

### 3. **Product Management**
   - **Inventory Management System**: 
      - Tracks stock levels, suppliers, and product variations (sizes, types, etc.).
      - Alerts for low stock levels and automatic reordering processes.
   - **Supplier Management**:
      - Database of suppliers for surgical instruments and other products.
      - Interfaces for managing supplier-related information and purchase orders.

### 4. **Payment Processing**
   - **Payment Gateway Integration**:
      - Secure handling of payment information through providers such as Stripe, PayPal, or local payment gateways.
      - Compliance with PCI DSS standards for secure transactions.

      - Utilize services such as load balancers, auto-scaling, and CDN for improved performance.
   - **Backup and Recovery**:
      - Regular backups of application and database data to prevent data loss.
      - Disaster recovery planning for critical system failures.

### 9. **Content Management**
   - **CMS for Blog and Resources**:
